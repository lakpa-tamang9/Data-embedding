#Data Embedding
Data Embedding is popular in stegaography, watermarking and display to camera communication. The term embedding refers to insert any thing inside of other. So, here i will present the demo of embedding data inside the image. The data can be any thing (text/image/video) in the form of binary format. Think this as a normal QR code system. In QR code system, data is inserted into a 2D barcodes of two colors (black and white). This serves only data hiding purpose whereas if we are able to hide something inside image, then it will serve both the purpiose of information hiding and also the visual content of the image.
